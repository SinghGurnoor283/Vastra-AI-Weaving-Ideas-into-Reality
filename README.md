Vastra AI: Weaving Ideas into Reality
Vastra AI is a complete, AI-powered fashion design and discovery platform. It serves as a personal fashion assistant that helps users visualize their ideas, discover new styles, and connect with local fashion services.

‚ú® Key Features
AI Image Generation: The core of the app. Users can type any fashion idea into the search bar (e.g., "a modern sherwani for a wedding"), and the AI generates a unique, high-quality image of that outfit in seconds.

AI Color Studio: When viewing an image, the app can analyze its dominant colors and, using color theory, suggest harmonious color palettes (Complementary, Analogous, etc.) to inspire new creative ideas.

Trending Page: To keep users inspired, the app has a "Trending" section that automatically scrapes the latest men's and women's fashion designs from Pinterest, ensuring the content is always fresh.

Personalized Recommendations: The app uses a Machine Learning model to analyze the images users create. It learns their personal "style profile" and then recommends other popular designs from the platform that match their taste.

Find Fashion Services: The app uses a user's location to display a map of nearby fashion services, like tailors, boutiques, and fabric stores, helping to turn AI-generated ideas into reality.

User Accounts & Favorites: Users can create an account to save all their generated designs. They can also "favorite" any design‚Äîwhether it's one they created or one from the trending page‚Äîto save it to a personal collection.

Multilingual Support: The entire app works in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Punjabi, and French). The AI can even understand design prompts written in any of these languages.
